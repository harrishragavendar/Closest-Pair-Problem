# Closest-Pair-Problem
## Problem: Finds the two closest points in a set of n points.
# Brute-Force Approach
## -> Compute the distance between each pair of distinct points.
## -> Find a pair with the smallest distance. 
## -> It is not needed to compute the distance between the same pair of points twice. To avoid it, consider only the pairs of points (pi, pj) for which i < j.
